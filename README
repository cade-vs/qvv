NAME

  QVV -- Qt-based compact image viewer

SYNOPSIS

  qvv [image-files...]

  QVV will open all images specified at the command line.
  If started without arguments, will open file browser window.

INSTALL

  QVV supports QT 4.x and QT 5.x.

  to generate compile Makefile you have to choose appropriate qmake file:

  qvv.qt4.pro   -- for QT 4.x
  qvv.qt5.pro   -- for QT 5.x

  qmake is Qt utility which creates Makefile accordingly to your Qt
  installation paths and other parameters.

  type "qmake qvv.qt4.pro" or "qmake qvv.qt5.pro" and wait for Makefile to
  be generated.

  type 'make' and wait for the 'qvv' binary -- if you don't succeed
  try use precompiled qvv pack or contact the author.

  QVV has no external run-time dependancies.

  then take qvv binary and put it somewhere in the $PATH, for example
  /usr/local/bin/  or  /usr/bin/  are fine.

  requirements for compile process:

  Qt 4.x -- http://qt.io
  Qt 5.x -- http://qt.io
