  Few random notes...

  QVV is made in early 1999. I was really frustrated  about Windows as
  development and desktop environment. So I switched my machine to Linux.

  In early 1999 there were not many graphical applications and very few
  image viewers with strange behaviour :) I remember xv.

  I felt like it was good time to learn a bit of Qt and fill my desktop
  "gap" for an image viewer app. It took me a bit under 2 hours to build
  working viewer. I consider this good achievement since I never used Qt
  at all. Those 2 hours were used and for reading docs :)

  Now it is late 2009. I tried for couple of days to port QVV to Qt 4.x
  without luck (Qt changed massively) so I decided to rewrite it from
  the scratch. And I'm quite happy with this decision :) QVV 4 looks great
  and will continue to update it as time allows.

  Qt is the greatest! :)

  Thanks for the attention!

  Vladi.
