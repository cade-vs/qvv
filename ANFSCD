  Few random notes...

  QVV is made in early 1999. I was really frustrated  about Windows as
  development and desktop environment. So I switched my machine to Linux.

  In early 1999 there were not many graphical applications and very few
  image viewers with strange behaviour :) xv rulz at the time... :)

  I felt like it was good time to learn a bit of Qt and fill my desktop
  "gap" for an image viewer app. It took me a bit under 2 hours (incl. RTFM)
  to build working viewer. I've never used Qt so it was a good achievement.

  In late 2009 I tried for couple of days to port QVV to Qt 4.x
  without luck (Qt changed massively) so I decided to rewrite it from
  the scratch. And I'm quite happy with this decision :) QVV 4 looks great
  and will continue to update it as time allows.

  Now it is early 2017 and QVV is the second most used application for me
  (after VFU file manager) so is the Qt and it is a fantastick track :))

  Qt is the greatest!

  Thanks,
    Vladi.
